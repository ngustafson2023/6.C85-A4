    <h2>Proposition: "The U.S. unemployment rate significantly decreased during President Barack Obama's administration due to effective economic policies."</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="True.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Here, we see a line chart depicting the change in the U.S. unemployment rate from 2007 through 2019. Clearly, we see that the unemployment rate had a dramatic
					fall from 9.25% to 4.36% under President Barack Obama's administration.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to include labels in my visualization. First, I included labels to indicate the start and end of Obama's presidential term. Second, 
					I included labels for the unemployment rates at these same start and end points. These labels helped pursuade the viewers in favor of the proposition
					because they solidified and emphasized the intended message of the visualization: unemployment drastically reduced during Obama's presidency. Score: 2.
				</li>
				<li>I chose to annotate the visualization a large dashed arrow. This design decision worked to provide even further emphasis to the aforementioned 
					intended message. I decided to make it point down, in the direction of the trend, as well as make it very long to make the effect "louder". I decided to 
					make it dashed to clearly distinguish it as an annotation from its neighboring solid data line. It's start and end points, as well as slope, are arbritrary.
					Therefore, it is not very earnest, yet certainly not deceptive (as the trend is very clear). Score: 0.
				</li>
				<li>I chose to make the data line, as well as arrow annotation, green in color. This color (as opposed to red) is associated with positivity, thereby reinforcing
					the positive impact of Obama's administration on the economy. Score: 2.
				</li>
				<li>Lastly, I decided to trucate the y-axis to start at around 3.5, rather than 0. This decision allowed the line chart to be "stretched" vertically, thus 
					making the downward trend appear significantly steeper, longer, and altogether much more dramatic. This works to make the decrease in unemployment seem
					more abrupt, as if directly as a result of targeted intervention. Score: -1. 
				</li>

			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="False.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Here, we compare bar charts depicting changes in unemployment rates from 2007 through 2019 for high income countries, as well as the United States, United
					Kingdom, and Canada. Clearly, we see a closely-shared trend amongst all charts: an abrupt rise from 2007 through about 2010, then a gradual decline through 2019. 
					This indicates that the change in U.S. unemployment during Obama's presidency was likely not a result of any savvy economic policy, but rather a global recovery.  
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I made the explicit design decision to present the four trends in separate bar charts, rather than sharing a bar chart or line chart. In a shared line chart,
					the differences amongst trends are much more obvious. In a shared bar chart, the common trend is less obvious. In the chosen presentation, it is exceptionally
					clear that a strong common trend exists. Score: -2.
				</li>
				<li>I chose to include two clear annotations in the visualization: the repeated dashed arrows and the text box. The dashed arrow is repeated four times, each with
					the same length and slope, to emphasize the uniformity of the downward trend amongst all charts. As before, the start/end points and sloep are arbitrary. The 
					large textbox very clearly communicates, and draws immediate attention to, the intended message of the visualization: the downtrend in the US is not unique. 
					Score: -1.
				</li>
				<li>I chose to use a loud, negative color (red) to emphasize the annotations, and a very dry, neutral color (grey) to present the data. This is an intentional
					attempt to subconsciously sway viewers towards a negative perception of the data presented. Score: -0.25.
				</li>
				<li>I very intentionally decided to include High Income, the United Kingdom, and Canada for the explicit reason that they closely shared the general trend in
					unemployment of the United States, while all other categories and countries did not. Score: -2.
				</li>
			</ul>
